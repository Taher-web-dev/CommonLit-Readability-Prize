# CommonLit-Readability-Prize
CommonLit, Inc., is a nonprofit education technology organization serving over 20 million teachers and students with free digital reading and writing lessons for grades 3-12. Together with Georgia State University, an R1 public research university in Atlanta, they are challenging Kagglers to improve readability rating methods. In this competition, we had built algorithms to rate the complexity of reading passages for grade 3-12 classroom use. To accomplish this, we had used state of the art machine learning tools with a dataset that includes readers from a wide variety of age groups and a large collection of texts taken from various domains.
